This is example is a simple N-Dimension fitter that reads its input from XML
files. The input XML file defines any number of data points. For each point,
there must be a 'value','error' and any number of variables (any attribute that
isn't 'value' or 'error').  The user can then define any MINUIT parameters they
need and form an expression that will be fit to the data points.

See test.xml for an example of what an input file should look like and test.rb
for an example of how to use the fitter and access the results from MINUIT.
