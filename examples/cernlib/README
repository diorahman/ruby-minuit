This example is the one present in the cernlib package. In the fortran
directory, is the exact example code found in the cernlib package. In the ruby
directory, is the same problem implemented in Ruby using the ruby-minuit 
package.  

To compare the output of the fits you can:

1) > cd fortran
   > minexam

2) First make sure your RUBYLIB enviornment variable contains the location
   of ruby-pwa...if this is not set you will get an error when the code 
   attempts to load the Ruby Minuit module.

   > cd ruby
   > minexam.rb
